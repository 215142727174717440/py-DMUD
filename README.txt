Version : 0.1.2 (24-03-2020) 

To run this you'll need :
- to have a discord bot and put his token in the init.py file (some help on that here : https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html)
- to create a empty folder called players
- to have python 3.7 or more and the discord.py library

When you have all of this simply run the MAIN.py file.

If you want to access the admin commands, add your full discord pseudo to the admins list in admins.txt
